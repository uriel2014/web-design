# web-design

In this project we continue with adding an image as a background-image for the
banner or section 1 of the webpage. We also add this to a special sub section of
section 2.

We split the webpage into three sections: section 1 to encompass the banner,
section 2 is to encompass the content of the webpage, section 3 is to reflect
the footer of the webpage.

We have basic use of the # for bookmarking also having a list. In the footer we
span all the elements in the same line.

All else is self-explanatory. We refer to some styling to make the webpage pop.
The styling is essentially covers elements that have been previous seen in prior
projects.
